# columbia-bootcamp-challenge-5

## Description
This project creates a Task Board application that allows users to organize tasks into to-do lists, in-progress, and done. Users can easily add and delete tasks, as well as move them between different lists. The Task Board provides a visual representation of the user's tasks, making it easier to track progress and manage workload. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Bootstrap framework for responsive design and the DayJS library for timing as well as JQuery and JQueryUI.
